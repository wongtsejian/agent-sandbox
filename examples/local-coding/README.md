# Local Coding Example

A sandboxed codex agent for local machine coding, with LLM API access routed through the gateway's credential injection.

## What's Included

- **external-services** — gateway intercepts HTTPS requests to `agent-gateway.stx-ai.net` via MITM and injects your real API key. The agent never sees the credential.
- **custom-runtime** — overlays codex configuration (model catalog, provider settings) into the agent's home directory.

## Setup

```bash
cd examples/local-coding

# Generate build artifacts
agent-sandbox generate

# Create .env from the example
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in:
#   STX_LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Build and run
agent-sandbox compose up --build
```

## Usage

Once the containers are running, exec into the agent container as the `agent` user:

```bash
agent-sandbox -C examples/local-coding compose exec -it --user agent coder codex
```

> **Note:** The `--user agent` flag is required. Without it, `exec` runs as root and codex won't find its config (which lives at `/home/agent/.codex/`).

## Architecture

```
LLM API (agent-gateway.stx-ai.net)
     ↕ (real API key injected by gateway)
  Gateway (MITM for agent-gateway.stx-ai.net)
     ↕
  Agent (codex with dummy bearer token)
```

The real API key never enters the agent's environment — it's only available to the gateway process.
