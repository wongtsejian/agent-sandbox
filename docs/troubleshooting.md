# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### `agent-sandbox generate` fails with "runtime not found"

The CLI can't find a runtime plugin matching your `runtime:` field.

**Fix:** Check spelling in `agent.yaml`. Available built-in runtimes: `codex`, `claude-code`, `pi`. For custom runtimes, use inline definition or place `runtime.yaml` in `ext/plugins/<name>/`.

### Container won't start: "gateway host not found"

The agent container can't resolve the gateway container hostname at startup.

**Fix:** Make sure both services are on the same Docker network. Run `agent-sandbox generate` to regenerate the compose file, then `agent-sandbox compose up --build`.

### Agent can't reach the internet (connection timeouts)

All traffic routes through the gateway container. If the gateway isn't running or is unhealthy, outbound connections fail.

**Checks:**
```bash
# Verify both containers are running
agent-sandbox compose ps

# Check gateway logs
agent-sandbox compose logs gateway

# Verify gateway is healthy from inside agent
agent-sandbox compose exec agent ping -c1 gateway
```

### MITM certificate errors (TLS handshake failure)

The sandbox CA certificate isn't trusted inside the agent container. This affects MITM'd hosts only (e.g., github.com when using the github-pat plugin).

**Checks:**
```bash
# Verify CA cert is installed
agent-sandbox compose exec agent ls /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/sandbox-ca.crt

# Verify it's in the trust store
agent-sandbox compose exec agent update-ca-certificates --fresh
```

If using a custom base image, make sure `ca-certificates` is installed and `update-ca-certificates` runs after the sandbox CA is copied.

### Telegram bot not responding

**Checks:**
1. Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set in your `.env` file
2. Check channel manager logs: `agent-sandbox compose logs agent | grep -i telegram`
3. Verify `allowed_users` in your config matches your Telegram username
4. Make sure you've started a conversation with the bot first (send `/start`)

### Environment variables not injected

The CLI scans for `${VAR}` patterns and generates `.env.example`. Actual values must be in a `.env` file next to your `agent.yaml`.

**Fix:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with real values
```

### Container rebuilds are slow

Docker layer caching helps. The gateway stage rarely changes, so only the agent stage rebuilds on config changes.

**Tips:**
- Don't modify `agent.yaml` fields that affect early Dockerfile layers (runtime, base packages) frequently
- Use `runtime_volumes` for large persistent data instead of home-override (avoids COPY on every rebuild)

### "Permission denied" on entrypoint hooks

Hook scripts must be executable.

**Fix:**
```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/my-hook.sh
```

### Agent exits immediately (no channel configured)

Without a channel plugin (e.g., telegram), the default CMD is `sleep infinity`. If your agent exits immediately, check:

1. Your runtime's `cmd` field in runtime.yaml
2. Whether you have a channel configured but the channel manager is crashing (check logs)

If your issue isn't listed here:

1. Check logs: `agent-sandbox compose logs`
2. Inspect generated artifacts: `ls .build/`
3. Verify config: review `agent.yaml` against [Configuration docs](configuration.md)
